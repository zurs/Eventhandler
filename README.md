# Eventhandler
An app built with Phonegap and a server in PHP. Created as an app to easily manage and log participants at events.
Created specifically for an association in Växjö who holds events in boardgames mainly, and needed an easier way to log participants that participated.

Uses a server running PHP and a backend database.
Right now the browser admin-page is just a quick thrown-up page and needs a little more to acctually be production-ready, but the app and server is done, which was the main goal here.
